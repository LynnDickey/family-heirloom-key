## 🔐 Understanding Privacy & Security

### Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)

- **Private Values**: Heirloom monetary values are encrypted and never revealed
- **Secure Verification**: Inheritance requests use encrypted proof-of-life
- **Zero-Knowledge**: The system verifies conditions without exposing sensitive data

### Security Best Practices

- **Backup Your Seed Phrase**: Never share your wallet's recovery phrase
- **Verify Addresses**: Always double-check heir addresses before creation
- **Use Strong Passwords**: Protect your wallet with strong security
- **Keep Software Updated**: Use the latest versions of wallets and browsers

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Transaction Failed"
- **Cause**: Insufficient gas or network congestion
- **Solution**: Try increasing gas limit or waiting for network to clear

#### "Invalid Heir Address"
- **Cause**: The provided address is not a valid Ethereum address
- **Solution**: Verify the address format (should start with 0x and be 42 characters)

#### "Inheritance Deadline Too Soon"
- **Cause**: Deadline must be at least 1 year from creation
- **Solution**: Choose a future date at least 365 days from now

#### "Contract Paused"
- **Cause**: Emergency pause activated by contract owner
- **Solution**: Wait for the contract to be unpaused or contact support

#### "Wallet Connection Failed"
- **Cause**: Network issues or wallet configuration problems
- **Solution**: Refresh the page, check your wallet connection, or try a different browser
